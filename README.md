# Hangul Clock (한글시계)
## What's it for?

The development of HangulClock was conducted as a part of "Korea Global Intelligence Global Mentoring" ([국인 글로벌 멘토링](http://www.global-intelligence.co.kr/globalmentoring)) campaign.

This is a volunteer campaign aiming to help Korean Teenagers in Japan (재일교포 청소년) learn Korean and Korean culture.

Below are some photos of Korean Teenagers in Japan each working on their own Hangul Clock (Pictures from 2023).

## What is Hangul Clock exactly?
Hangul is the writing system used in Korea. Hangul clock is a clock system that uses 25 Korean characters placed on a 5 by 5 grid. 

Depending on the current time, the corresponding characters are lit up to display the time in Korean.

For example, below is the original Hangul Clock prototype we made. In the picture, the Korean characters for "네 시 삼 십 분" is lit up.

This translates to "4(네) hour(시) 3(삼) 10(십) minute(분)" which is "four thirty (4:30)" in English.

## Why are you helping Korean Teenagers in Japan learn Korean? 

Korean Teenagers in Japan, and also many [ethnic Koreans in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans_in_Japan#Before_World_War_II) (재일교포), originate from the Japanese annexation of Korea.

Although these teenagers are born and raised in Japan, they are **not** acknowledged as Japanese citizens in Japan, due to their ethnicity. 

Korea Global Intelligence ([국인](http://www.global-intelligence.co.kr)) is a group of Korean students who help teenagers who want to learn more about their ethnic origins.

**I'm not personally a part of the 국인 group**, but I volunteered to put my electronic & coding skills to a good cause.

I developed the prototype Hangul Clock with my friend (who is part of the group), to help these teenagers learn Korean & Korean time system.

While our prototype design is no longer used, Hangul Clock is still a staple of the 국인 volunteer program and is still largely based on our original design, five years later.
